#+title: ESS with Spacemacs

[[../resources/spacemacs-logo.png]]

* Goals of this presentation

1. Convey why Spacemacs might be of interest to ESS users
   - What is Spacemacs and why it is useful
2. Ultra-quick start guide to ESS via Spacemacs
   - Installation to a full R development environment
3. Give pointers for further Spacemacs use
   - Further resources to extract the most of out this kit.

** Who is this for?

Users of R who are interested in the one true editor but not sure where to
start, or existing emacs/ESS devotees who want to know what all the fuss about
Spacemacs is.

* What is Spacemacs?

Spacemacs is a configuration of emacs. It is designed to offer a nice experience
out-of-the-box and provides a framework for further customisation. Spacemacs has
a consistent interface with an emphasis on mnemonics intended to create
discoverable keybindings. The former means that once you learn how to use
Spacemacs for working in one language, it is very easy to transfer that
knowledge when working with another language. The later means that you don't
need to dig through the documentation to figure out how to perform simple tasks
and. As a result you spend more time on your code and less on your coding
environment. The design of Spacemacs is largely influenced by four core pillars.

* Core pillars

Spacemacs has been designed along the lines of the following core pillars. The
following is taken from the documentation.

#+begin_quote
Four core pillars: Mnemonic, Discoverable, Consistent and "Crowd-Configured".

If any of these core pillars is violated open an issue and we'll try our best to
fix it.
#+end_quote

** mnemonics and discoverability

Keybindings start with =SPC= followed by a sequence of letters related to the
function they invoke. For example, you can /toggle/ to the next beautiful colour
scheme with =SPC T n=. There are more keybindings than most people will ever be
able to remember, but you can often guess the keybindings for common
functionality.

- /buffers/ =SPC b=
- /files/ =SPC f=
  + /find file/ =SPC f f=
  + dired /jump/ =SPC f j=
- /git/ =SPC g= for the the magit layer
- /jump/ to definition /in/ the file with =SPC j i=
- /modes/ =SPC m=
  + /go/ to a definition =SPC m g=
  + /send/ code to the REPL =SPC m s=
  + /evaluate/ code =SPC m e=
- /quit/ =SPC q= for the many ways to quit emacs (sorry vim).
- /search/ =SPC s= for search
  + /search/ the current buffer with =SPC s s=
  + /search/ the /project/ with =SPC s p=
- /windows/ =SPC w=

If you can't guess the keybinding but you know part of the name of the function
you can search for the documentation (which includes current bindings) with =SPC
h d f= which you can probably guess stands for /help/, /describe/, /function/.
If you want to know the precise function bound to keys there is also =SPC h d
k=.

** consistency

Consistency is one of the killer features of Spacemacs, the bindings are very
consistent across layers which makes switching between languages very easy and
makes it very easy to set up a development environment for a new language.

[[https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html]]

** Crowd-configured

There is not enough time to do statistics and to get your emacs configuration
perfect. Spacemacs means that you can leverage the work of the community to get
a really nice editor.

While writing the document, several members of the Spacemacs community pointed
out great features that I wasn't aware of which have, with hindsight, very
obvious bindings. Unfortunately for me, the discoverable nature of this
functionality only works if you pay enough attention to recognise it! Lucky for
me, there is a thriving Spacemacs community to point these things out.

* Are you trying to convert me?

It's no secret that vim keybindings are popular among Spacemacs users. As the
Spacemacs documentation says: "The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's
Emacs and Vim!" In fact, there is a vim port of Spacemacs: [[https://spacevim.org/][SpaceVim]]. Don't worry
though, both sets of keybindings are supported as well as mixed versions.

* Ultra-quick start guide

There is a proper [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#install][installation guide]] on GitHub, but here are the main steps.
Followed by a simple example to demonstrate what ESS looks like in Spacemacs.

** Clone the Spacemacs repository

*WARNING:* Please back up any existing configuration files before proceeding.
The command below will attempt to clone Spacemacs into a directory,
=~/.emacs.d=

Cloning the Spacemacs repository from github using the command shown below
creates a =.emacs.d= directory in your home directory. It is this repository
that contains the actual Spacemacs configuration. For the most part you can just
ignore this though. Emacs will find this information on start up and guide you
through the rest of the installation.

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d 
#+end_src

[[../resources/clone-spacemacs.png]]

At this point, you may want to double check that the contents of the directory
=~/.emacs.d= looks like the code on the GitHub page.

** Develop is default

Please note that the /default/ branch of Spacemacs is =develop=, so you will be
on this branch when you clone the repository. You should stick to this branch
unless you have a good reason not to. There is a =master= branch, but it has
gone stale and should not be consumed.

** Start emacs and face the Wizard

When you first start emacs after cloning the Spacemacs repository you should see
the Spacemacs logo and there will be a message from a start up wizard in the
mode line. The wizard will ask you a two questions: vim or emacs keybindings and
do you want a standard or a light installation. The defaults of vim and and
standard work well.

[[../resources/spacemacs-startup-1.png]]

The wizard will generate another file in your home directory, =.spacemacs=. This
file is useful for finetuning how Spacemacs works and brings us to an important
concept in Spacemacs: /layers/.

** An interlude into layers

The documentation describes layers in the following way.

#+begin_quote
A collected unit of configuration that can be enabled (or disabled) in
Spacemacs. A layer typically brings together one or more packages, as well as
the glue configuration code required to make them play well with each other and
Spacemacs in general.
#+end_quote

Layers are sets of major and minor modes that play well together and make it
easier to do task /X/. There is an ESS layer, which includes ESS but also a bunch
of other nifty packages that you will likely want to have loaded when doing
statistical work.

There are a huge range of layers that have been carefully crafted, you might
want to check out the [[https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/LAYERS.html][listing]] to see if there are others that might be useful.
If you like language /Y/, there is probably a layer for that. Moreover, it will
probably expose near identical key-bindings to the layer for language /Z/, which
makes it much simpler to use multiple languages.

** Open the configuration file: =SPC f e d=

/Okay, so now we know what layers are, how do we tell Spacemacs which ones we
want?/ This is done using the =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= variable in
the =.spacemacs= file, which was automagically generated when you installed
Spacemacs. You can visit the =.spacemacs= file using =SPC f e d= (ie press the
space bar, then the f-key, then the e-key then the d-key).

** Set up your layers in =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=

There are lots of options in the =.spacemacs= file, and the vast majority can be
ignored. The =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= variable is defined around
line 30. Once you have found the variable, set its value to something like the
example below. There will likely be some recommended layers already there, it's
fine to leave them, you just need to make sure you have some layer called
=shell= and the =ess= layer.

[[../resources/add-ess-layer.png]]

** Restart: =SPC q r=

You probably don't need to restart emacs at this point, you could instead just
reload the configuration with =SPC f e R=, but doing a full restart shouldn't
take long and is more reliable.

** Profit!

Amazingly that is all that you needed to do! You now have access to many
carefully crafted layers which cover nearly all things you might want to do in
emacs, there is even a spotify layer.

* Example

** Opening a shell and setting up the example

- =SPC '= to start a shell
  + change to the =example= directory of this repository.
  + use =ls= to confirm =demo.R= is there.
- =SPC f f= to visit (/find/) the /file/ =demo.R=
  + Add an expression to the file, e.g. =print("hello world")=.
  + Save the buffer with =SPC f s=, i.e. /file/ and /save/.

[[../resources/shell-and-new-file.png]]

** Visiting a file and starting a REPL

- =SPC m '= to start a REPL
  + It will ask you to choose the intial working directory
  + Navigate between /windows/ by =SPC w= and selecting an action
- /Send/ the whole /buffer/ with =SPC s b=.
- /Send/ the selected /region/ with =SPC s r=.

[[../resources/buffer-and-repl.png]]

** Kill the REPL

You can use =C-x k= to select a buffer to /kill/. For example you could use this
and then select the R REPL. Alternatively, there is the more memorable =SPC b d=
which I suppose corresponds to /buffer/ and /delete/.

* More ESS

** More IDE features with LSP

The ESS layer has a lot more statistics oriented features. To learn more about
these, check out the [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/ess/README.html][ESS layer documentation]]. There are instructions there on
setting up LSP, which is surprisingly easy! Just add the LSP layer to your layer
list and tell ESS that you want to use LSP with the following.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ess :variables ess-r-backend 'lsp)
#+end_src

Note that for this to work, you'll need the R package, =languageserver=
installed. It is available on CRAN. If you use other languages such as Stan and
MATLAB, there are links there to the [[https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/major-modes/README.html][extra languages]] layer. If at some later
point you want to turn off the LSP backend but want to keep the =lsp= layer for
use with other languages, you can set the =ess-r-backend= value to ='ess=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ess :variables ess-r-backend 'ess)
#+end_src

* More Spacemacs

The Spacemacs community is very friendly, I asked for reviews of this document
on gitter and GitHub and got some really nice responses. The following places
might be useful starting points to learn a bit more.

- Documentation builtin: =SPC h SPC=
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs]]
- There is a vim clone [[https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim][SpaceVim]]
- My tweaks to Spacemacs are documented [[https://github.com/aezarebski/nicemacs][here]].
  
* Gotchas

** Did you /really/ clone Spacemacs?

If you already have a =.emacs.d= directory, the command to clone Spacemacs may
not work as expected. Please double check that the contents of that directory
look like the code on GitHub if you are having trouble getting Spacemacs to
start.

** Vim keybindings while viewing Info pages

I find Info pages confusing in general, but they seem even more confusing via
Spacemacs. The keys =np[]lrmsb<SPC>= all kind of work provided you hit =\= first
to jump into emacs keybindings. To navigate around the text, you get =hjkl= by
default. The most Spacemacs-ey keybindings for working with Info pages seems to
be a topic of debate, but if you are reading this, you might find the persistent
which-key approach interesting.

** Source Code Pro and fonts in general

Spacemacs seems to like to use source code pro, this beyond the scope of this
presentation, but there are good instructions for installing it all over the
internet. It appears that Spacemacs works fine even if you do not have Source
Code Pro available, so there is no need to get hung up on this. There is a
section of the documentation that deals with fonts for Spacemacs:
https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#font

** Warnings when updating packages

Whenever I update my packages there are often warnings. For the most part these
don't seem to cause any real problems. It would be nice to address these, but
until it breaks I'm reluctant to sink much time into this. I've never needed to
use the "rollback updates" button, but it is comforting to know it is there...
